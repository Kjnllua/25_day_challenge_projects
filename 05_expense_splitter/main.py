# Homework:
# 1. Handle what happens if the user taps on enter without specifying a total bill amount
# 2. Handle what happens if the user doesn't add and people to the bill
# 3. Make it so the user can only charge up to 100% of the bill
# 4. Add a field to the summary that tells the user the money that wasn't split by anyone
